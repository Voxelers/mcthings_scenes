# Repository of Scenes for McThings

This is the repository in which McThings scenes are shared.

If you want to add a scene to this directory:

* Scenes should be implemented using Jupyter Notebooks or as Python apps
* Notebooks shall follow the [scene temples](notebooks/scene_template.ipynb)
* Scenes must be sent following the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
